# Solparse Exp

Pegjs-based Parser for the Solidity Programming language.

This is a fork of [duaraghav8 Solparse](https://github.com/duaraghav8/solparse) which was a fork of the original [Consensys' solidity-parser](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser) by Tim Coulter. @cgewecke, @duaraghav8 and @federicobond are co-authors.

## Note
This version was created primarily to work with https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity, and added IncompleteBlock to help on not completed statements, but over the years as it has continued to be updated remains as the only solidity parser that uses PEG.

If you are not interested in "IncompleteBlock" it can be removed or commented out for your own needs. Or 2 parsers can be included in the package, raise an issue if this is your requirement.

Fixes welcome :)
